This project is a community effort to share knowledge about cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The original repository contained curated tools, PDFs, and links which are now organized on this site.

## Mission

We aim to make cybersecurity knowledge accessible and responsible — teaching defensive skills and ethical testing practices so people and organizations can better protect themselves.

## Contribute

- Add resources as issues or pull requests
- Add your own write-ups, tools, or responsibly disclosed findings (only for authorized testing environments)

> **Ethics note:** Do not use tools or techniques on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
