This is a small initiative to create a big hacker community. I am a hacker and I want that in our future people should not be threatened by hackers but should get security. For which this community has been created. In which hackers from all over the world will meet and discuss different topics and give as much knowledge as possible, so join this community.

## Site and Resume

A minimal static site has been added at `docs/` with a "Resume" page. To publish your resume:

1. Add a file named `resume.pdf` to the repository root or `docs/`.
2. Commit and push to GitHub (example: `git add resume.pdf && git commit -m "Add resume" && git push`).
3. The included GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) will automatically publish `docs/` to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

After the workflow runs, your site will be available at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/` and the resume at `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/resume.pdf`.

If you want, I can also create a sample `resume.pdf` or push these changes to your remote—tell me whether you'd like me to push.
